### About wireless adapters
Your wireless adapter and your kernel driver must support AP mode. In order to check this, execute this shell command:
``` sh
 iw list
```
If there is 'AP' in the list of "Supported interface modes", your card has support for the desired mode.

### Another method:
* Find your kernel driver module in use by issuing the below command:
``` sh
 lspci -k | grep -A 3 -i network
```
(example module: ath9k)
next, use the below command to find out your wifi capabilities (replace ath9k by your kernel driver):
``` sh
modinfo ath9k | grep depend
```
If the above output includes "mac80211" then it means your wifi card will support the AP mode.

 The adapter needs to have drivers for GNU/Linux.
