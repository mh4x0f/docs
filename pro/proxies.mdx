The proxies are designed to add features to WP3 Pro core and run parallel with access point (AP).The proxies work by intercepting a request, modifying the request if necessary, then handling or forwarding the request to its destination.

WP3 Pro supports two main types of proxies:

---

#### 1️⃣ Intercept Proxies
- **Purpose:** Capture and inspect network traffic in real-time.  
- **How they work:**  
  - Intercept requests from connected clients.  
  - Optionally modify request or response data.  
  - Forward traffic to its intended destination.  
- **Common use cases:**  
  - Injecting payloads.  
  - Modifying HTTP responses.  
  - Collecting credentials.  

---

#### 2️⃣ Captive Portal Proxies
- **Purpose:** Redirect all client requests to a specific web page before granting internet access.  
- **How they work:**  
  - Force all HTTP requests to a local login or information page.  
  - Can simulate public Wi-Fi login portals.  
  - Often used for phishing scenarios or credential harvesting.  
- **Common use cases:**  
  - Fake login pages.  
  - Terms-of-service acceptance pages.  
  - Social engineering experiments.

<Info title="Proxy Limitation">
Only one proxy can be run at a time, as each proxy is designed to **manipulate and redirect data packets** through a specific port.
</Info>

Avaliable proxies:

- [**phishportal**](/pro/phishportal/introduction) - Allow block Internet access for users until they open the page login page.
- [**flowtamper**](/pro/flowtamper/introduction) - Allow block Internet access for users until they open the page login page.
- **noproxy** - Runnning without proxy redirect traffic

The basic command guidelines to get a plugins are:

If you want to see the available proxies in WP3 Pro, run the following command in the CLI:

```bash
wp3-pro > proxies
```

if you want to select the proxy, follow command bellow. 
```bash
wp3-pro > set proxies.<proxyname> true
```

If you want to change the port of a proxy, use the following command in the WP3 Pro CLI:
```bash
wp3-pro > set <proxyname>.port 8080
```
