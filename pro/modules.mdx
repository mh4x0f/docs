Modules provide **additional functionalities** that are not strictly required to operate the access point (AP).  
They are designed to **extend WP3 Pro** with new capabilities, such as:

- Deauthentication Wifi Attacks  
- Network Recon and Handshake Capture
- Network Protocol Monitor (HTTP, FTP, DNS, DHCP and more)
- Web Interaction and more  

Modules complement the main attack or monitoring functionality, allowing users to perform a wide range of tasks beyond simply running an AP.
