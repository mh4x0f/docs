### Recommended Wireless Adapters

Below is a list of USB Wi-Fi adapters that work well with **Kali Linux**, supporting both **AP mode** and **Monitor mode**.  
These models are widely tested in penetration testing environments.

| Model | Chipset | Speed | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|-------|
| **Alfa AWUS036NHA** | Atheros AR9271 | 150 Mbps | Excellent AP & Monitor support, very stable |
| **Alfa AWUS036NH** | Ralink RT3070 | 150 Mbps | Good range, works out-of-the-box on Kali |
| **Alfa AWUS036ACM** | MediaTek MT7612U | 867 Mbps | Dual-band, stable driver support |
| **TP-Link TL-WN722N** *(v1 only)* | Atheros AR9271 | 150 Mbps | Affordable, strong community support |
| **Panda Wireless PAU06** | Ralink RT5372 | 300 Mbps | Reliable and compact |
| **Alfa AWUS036ACH** | Realtek RTL8812AU | 867 Mbps | Dual-band, requires driver installation |
| **Edimax EW-7811UAC** | Realtek RTL8812AU | 867 Mbps | Compact dual-band adapter |
<Note>
ðŸ’¡ **Note:**  
The **Atheros AR9271** (e.g., Alfa AWUS036NHA, TP-Link TL-WN722N v1) is known for its excellent performance and compatibility.  
Avoid newer TL-WN722N versions (v2/v3) â€” they do **not** support monitor mode properly.  
For **dual-band** support (2.4GHz & 5GHz), prefer chipsets like **MT7612U** or **RTL8812AU**.

### About wireless adapters
Your wireless adapter **and** its kernel driver must support **AP mode**.  
To check this, run the following shell command:
``` sh
 iw list
```
If there is 'AP' in the list of "Supported interface modes", your card has support for the desired mode.

### Another method:
Find the kernel driver module in use for your Wi-Fi card:

``` sh
 lspci -k | grep -A 3 -i network
```
Example output may show a module like ath9k.
next, use the below command to find out your wifi capabilities (replace ath9k by your kernel driver):
``` sh
modinfo ath9k | grep depend
```
If the output includes "mac80211", it indicates that your Wi-Fi card supports AP mode.

 The adapter needs to have drivers for GNU/Linux.
