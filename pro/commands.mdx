### Interactive Session

Once started the tool with `sudo wifipumpkin3-pro` ,  you'll be presented with an interactive session like the `metasploit framework` where you can enable or disable modules, proxies configure the ap and etc. 

- Enable or disable modules and proxies.
- Configure the access point (AP) settings.
- Start or stop the AP.
- Monitor client activity connected to the AP.
- Set session parameters such as BSSID, channel, and interface.

The CLI is simple and intuitive, providing all the basic commands you need to perform operations efficiently.

### Web User Interface (WebUI)

In addition to the CLI, wifipumpkin3-pro provides a Web-based interface for easier management:
Access the WebUI through your browser (default URL: http://127.0.0.1:80).
- Monitor the AP status, connected clients, and active modules in real-time.
- Configure AP settings, proxies, and modules without using the CLI.
- Provides visual logs and statistics for better tracking and analysis.
Default login credentials for the WebUI:
```bash
Username: user
Password: user
```
<Note>
ðŸ’¡ Note: The WebUI is optional but highly recommended for users who prefer a graphical interface over command-line operations.
