# Net Sniffer (`net.sniff`)

<Card title="net.sniff" img="/images/pro/modules/net.sniff.png">

</Card>

The **`net.sniff`** module in WP3 Pro allows you to **sniff network packets in the background**.  
It is designed to run silently and capture traffic for analysis, debugging, or penetration testing purposes.

When started, it can capture packets from specified interfaces, apply filters, and optionally store the results in a file.

---

## Module Usage

```bash
wp3-pro > net.sniff on      # Start the network sniffer
wp3-pro > net.sniff off     # Stop the network sniffer
```


 ### Description

- net.sniff (not running): Sniffs packets in the background.

Purpose: Start or stop a network sniffer that captures packets silently.

### Parameters

You can configure net.sniff using the following parameters:

| Parameter                | Description                                                                 | Default                        |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `net.sniff.broadcast`    | Send packets to all processors.                                             | false                          |
| `net.sniff.filter`       | BPF filter for the sniffer (e.g., tcp or udp).                             | tcp or udp                     |
| `net.sniff.interface`    | Interface to sniff packets from (e.g., wlan0).                             | (none)                         |
| `net.sniff.output`       | File where captured packets will be saved.                                  | (none)                         |
| `net.sniff.protocol`     | Protocol processors to use when broadcast is false. Options: http, dns, sni, ftp, smtp, mdns, ssdp | http, dns, sni, ftp, smtp, mdns, ssdp |
| `net.sniff.verbose`      | Enable verbose mode to log packets in real-time.                            | false                          |

### Examples CLI 

Start the sniffer on a specific interface and save output to a file:
```bash
wp3-pro > set net.sniff.interface wlan0
wp3-pro > set net.sniff.output /tmp/capture.pcap
wp3-pro > net.sniff on
```

Enable verbose mode to see packets in real-time:
```bash
wp3-pro > set net.sniff.verbose true
wp3-pro > net.sniff on
```

Filter traffic to capture only HTTP packets:
```bash
wp3-pro > set net.sniff.filter tcp
wp3-pro > net.sniff.on
```

Summary

The net.sniff module is a lightweight, configurable packet sniffer integrated into WP3 Pro.
It allows you to monitor network traffic in the background, apply filters, capture specific protocols, and save packets for later analysis.
