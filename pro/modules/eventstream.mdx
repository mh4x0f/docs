The **Event Stream Module** provides real-time monitoring of system events inside **WP3 Pro**.  
It allows you to start or stop the event stream, display logs, and filter the events being captured.  
This is especially useful during pentesting sessions where tracking live activity is critical.

```bash
  wp3-pro > event.stream on
  wp3-pro > event.stream off

```bash

Filters allow you to fine-tune what events you see or log, avoiding unnecessary noise.
Logs can be redirected to external files for further analysis or archival.
