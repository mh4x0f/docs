The **Flowtamper Proxy** is a modular component designed for penetration testing and advanced network traffic analysis.  
It allows security professionals to intercept and inspect **HTTPS communications** on target devices after installing the appropriate SSL/TLS certificate.

It is designed for **offensive security testing** and **research scenarios**, where manipulating requests and responses provides deeper insights into system resilience.

---

âš¡ In short, the **FlowTamper Proxy** gives testers and researchers fine-grained control over live traffic, making it invaluable for **exploit development, vulnerability validation, and protocol security research**.

## Overview

### ðŸ”‘ Key Capabilities
- **Intercept & Modify Traffic**: Change HTTP/HTTPS headers, cookies, parameters, and body content on the fly.  
- **Session & Auth Testing**: Inject, strip, or alter authentication tokens (JWT, Bearer, cookies) to assess session management flaws.  
- **Bypass & Exploitation**: Test WAF/IDS evasion, exploit injection points (SQLi, XSS), and simulate edge-case client behaviors.  
- **Sensitive Data Extraction**: Detect leaked API keys, tokens, or secrets by tampering with API calls.  
- **Protocol Research**: Study how servers, APIs, or IoT devices react to malformed or unexpected traffic.

### ðŸŽ¯ Use Cases
- **Penetration Testing**: Validate vulnerabilities like IDOR, weak authentication, or improper input validation.  
- **Web & API Security**: Analyze and exploit insecure headers, caching issues, and API flaws.  
- **Mobile & IoT Research**: Intercept app/device traffic to discover hidden APIs or weak protocol implementations.  
- **Academic & Lab Research**: Experiment with protocol robustness, WAF bypass techniques, and new attack vectors.

Flowtamper provides a robust and configurable environment for analyzing, manipulating, and testing encrypted traffic, giving pentesters complete control over the data flow during engagements.
