The **Phishcloud Proxy** is a modular component designed to manage advanced **captive portal phishing scenarios**.  
It allows attackers and red team operators to deploy phishing-style portals behind a rogue Access Point (AP).  
When victims connect, they are transparently redirected to a **cloud-hosted phishing page over HTTPS**, leveraging external proxying tools such as **Evilginx3** or similar frameworks.

With **Phishcloud**, administrators and operators can:

- Seamlessly **intercept and redirect traffic** from Wi-Fi clients to controlled portals.  
- **Host phishing portals over HTTPS** without SSL certificate issues by using cloud infrastructure.  
- Integrate with external reverse-proxy phishing frameworks (e.g., **Evilginx3, Modlishka**) for advanced MFA and token harvesting.

## Key Features

- **Captive Portal Injection** – Forces Wi-Fi clients to the phishing page before granting internet access.  
- **Cloud Integration** – HTTPS-hosted phishing portals without self-signed certificate warnings.  
- **Proxy Support** – Works alongside Evilginx3 or other man-in-the-middle proxy frameworks.

## Use Cases

The **Phishcloud Proxy** is commonly used in:  

- **Red Team Operations** – Simulating real-world wireless phishing attacks during engagements.  
- **Penetration Testing** – Evaluating the resilience of organizations against captive portal phishing.  
- **Security Awareness Training** – Demonstrating realistic phishing scenarios to educate employees.  
- **Credential & MFA Bypass Assessments** – Testing how well security teams detect and respond to session hijacking or MFA token theft.
