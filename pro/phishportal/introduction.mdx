The **Phishportal Proxy** is a modular component designed to create and manage advanced **captive portal activities**.  
It provides the ability to set up a phishing-style portal served by an Access Point (AP), where users are redirected before gaining internet access.

With Phishportal, administrators can:

- Build **custom captive portal templates** with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Define **multi-step flows**, allowing users to go through several pages (e.g., login, verification, confirmation) before internet access is granted.
- Validate **form fields** (such as username, password, email, or tokens) using customizable rules.
- Collect and log submitted data for analysis or security testing.
- Integrate with other modules such as **proxies, DNS controllers, and firewall managers**.

### Key Features

- **Template-based design** – Each portal is built from customizable template folders.
- **Step-based user flow** – Users can be guided through multiple steps before network access.
- **Flexible validation** – Define validation logic for forms and fields.
- **Integration-ready** – Works seamlessly with the WiFiPumpkin3 Pro ecosystem.

### Use Case

The Phishportal Proxy is typically used in **red team operations, penetration testing, or network security research** to simulate real-world captive portals.  
By mimicking legitimate login or verification processes, it helps assess the effectiveness of security awareness and incident detection mechanisms.
