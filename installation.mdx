### OBS

- Windows is not supported.
- Mac OS X is not supported. only docker version, but has been not tested.

### Requirements

You will need to have a Wi-Fi adapter that supports **Access-Point (AP) mode**. The following list of OSs represents recommended environments to run `wifipumpkin3` (wp3), as most of required dependencies are pre-installed. VMs or docker are also recommended.

### OS (recommended)

| OS     | Version         |
| :----- | :-------------- |
| Ubuntu | \> 18.04 LTS    |
| Docker | \> Ubuntu 18.04 |

### Tools (pre-installed)

- iptables (current: iptables v1.6.1)
- iw (current: iw version 4.14)
- net-tools (current: version (1.60\+)
- wireless-tools (current: version 30~pre9-12)
- hostapd (current: hostapd v2.6)

### Based on Debian procedure

wifipumpkin3 use the port 53 for mount python dns server, when i try to install on Ubuntu 18.04, i got somes error because this "port 53 is used by another process". This problem is caused by systemd-resolved to solve only follow the step bellow.

1. stop systemd-resolved " sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved"
2. edit /etc/systemd/resolved.conf with these

3. and execute this link file

> sudo ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf

### Installation procedure

if you've **python 3.7 or later** installed on your machine, it very simple to install the **Wp3**. Follow the steps:

### Debian/Ubuntu

It is highly recommended install somes system packages, os-level dependencies.

```sh
sudo apt install python3.7-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev build-essential python3.7
```

```sh
 $ git clone https://github.com/P0cL4bs/wifipumpkin3.git
 $ cd wifipumpkin3
 $ sudo make install
```

or grab a Debian `*.deb` package from GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/P0cL4bs/wifipumpkin3/releases)

```sh
$ sudo dpkg -i wifipumpkin3-1.0.0-all.deb 
```

### Install on Kali Linux ( 2022.2 ) or high

wp3 can be install from `apt` command.

```sh
$ sudo apt install wifipumpkin3
```

### Install on Kali Linux

the Kali Linux by default has installed **python3.8** is compartible with `wp3`, I recommend to install some system packages, os-level dependencies.

```sh
 $ sudo apt install libssl-dev libffi-dev build-essential
 $ git clone https://github.com/P0cL4bs/wifipumpkin3.git
 $ cd wifipumpkin3
```

now, we need to install the `PyQt5`, it very easy:

```sh
sudo apt install python3-pyqt5
```

or check if the pyqt5 is installed successful:

```python
python3 -c "from PyQt5.QtCore import QSettings; print('done')"
```

now, if you got the message `done`, nice. the next step is install the `wp3`:

```sh
 $ sudo python3 -m pip install .
```

if you see this message bellow, everything ok \!

> Finished processing dependencies for wifipumpkin3==1.0.0

now, let's execute the app:

```
$ sudo  wifipumpkin3
```

all done, will be see the CLI of `wp3`.

### Installation python virtualenv

Virtualenv is a tool used to create an isolated Python environment. Virtualenv is the easiest and recommended way to configure a custom Python environment.

:::warning version of PyQt5
To install, change the version in `requirements.txt` from `PyQt5==5.14.0` to `PyQt5==5.14.2`.

This version (`5.14.2`) works fine on virtual environments without errors related to `python-sip` dependencies.
:::

```sh
$ sudo python3.7 -m pip install --upgrade pip
$ git clone https://github.com/P0cL4bs/wifipumpkin3.git
$ cd wifipumpkin3
$ sudo python3.7 -m pip install virtualenv
```

now, you need execute with superuser `root`:

```
# virtualenv -p python3.7 venv
# source venv/bin/activate
# make install_env
```

if you see this message bellow, everything ok \!

> Finished processing dependencies for wifipumpkin3==1.0.0

now, let's execute the app:

```
# wifipumpkin3
```

all done, will be see the CLI of `wp3` on virtualenv activated.

When finished working in the virtual environment, you can deactivate it by running the following:

```
# deactivate
```

### Installation on Docker Container

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. the `wp3` is full compatible to run on docker container. let's go:

> https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

with docker.io installed and working fine, let's take a look how to mount a container with `wp3`. [how to install on ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/P0cL4bs/wifipumpkin3.git
$ cd wifipumpkin3
$ sudo docker build -t "wifipumpkin3" .
```

this commands above will download and build a new container for us called `wifipumpkin3`, You'll see Docker step through each instruction in your Dockerfile, building up your image as it goes. If successful, the build process should end with a message:

> Successfully tagged wifipumpkin3

Now you need to run your image as a container, start a container based on your new image:

```bash
$ sudo docker run --privileged -ti --rm --name wifipumpkin3 --net host "wifipumpkin3" 
```

all done, will be see the CLI of `wp3` on docker with mode docker activated. ;)

### Installation on Docker-compose

Using the docker-compose.yml you can install the `w p3`. follow the steps,\
to build the image just run.

```bash
$ docker-compose build wifipumpkin3
```

To run a container

```bash
$ sudo docker-compose run wifipumpkin3 wifipumpkin3
```

To run a container with a pulp file

```sh
$ sudo docker-compose run wifipumpkin3 wifipumpkin3 --pulp scripts/demo.pulp
```

all done, will be see the CLI of `wp3` on docker with mode docker activated.
