### Interactive Session

Once started the tool with `sudo wifipumpkin3` ,  you'll be presented with an interactive session like the `metasploit framework` where you can enable or disable modules, plugin, proxy configure the ap and etc. 

The interface CLI is very simple, basic commands you'll need to perform operations such as setting a session like accesspoint (AP) information (bssid, channel, interface), start/stop accesspoint and monitor clients activitys joined on AP.

### Pulps

 `Pulps` makes reference to pulp taken from a pumpkin, which can be used for various mixtures. It is possible to script your interactive session using pulps files.  Pulps (script files with a .pulp extension) are a powerful way to automate your attack, like metasploit's `.rc` files, where each line of the file is a command that'll be executed one for one.

let's take a look, how to create a script for set the interface, enable to start without proxy,set ssid the network, set work without log for dns and start the access point.

```python
# configure the interface
set interface wlan1 
# set name of access point will be created
set ssid demo
# set noproxy plguin
set proxy noproxy
# ignore all log from pydns_server 
ignore pydns_server
# start the Access Point
start
```

Once saved as demo.pulp file, you'll be able to load and execute it via:

```bash
sudo wifipumpkin3 --pulp /path/to/demo.pulp
```

if you not want to use .pulp file, exist a options to use the paraments --xpulp or -x and each command can either be executed singularly, or concatenated by the `;` in string. for example:

```bash
sudo wifipumpkin3 --xpulp "set interface wlan1; set ssid demo; set proxy noproxy; start"
```

### Arguments Commands

The basic command line arguments ( wifipumpkin3 -h ) are:

```bash
-i INTERFACE 
```
Network interface to bind to, if empty the default interface is old session started.

```bash
-s SESSION
```
Session for continue attack, if you pass the old session id, all log will be added on same session.

```bash
--pulp PULP
```
Interactive sessions can be scripted with .pulp file,a powerful way to automate your attack.

```bash
--xpulp XPULP
```
each command can either be executed singularly, or concatenated by the ; in string.

```bash
--wireless-mode WIRELESS_MODE
```
Use this options for set the wireless mode (static, docker), by default is `static`  mode, but you can change if you want to run on docker container.

```bash
--no-colors
```
disable terminal colors and effects.

```bash
-v, --version
```
show program's version number and exit.

### Core Commands

>  `help`

Will list all available commands avaliable

> `clients`

show all clients connected on Access Point with advanced UI

> `ap`

show all variable and status for settings AP. You can see (`bssid`, `ssid`, `channel`, `security`,  or `status ap`)

> `set`

set variable proxy,plugin and access point, this command set is like metasploit `set` command.

> `unset`

unset variable commnd hostapd_config

> `start`

start access point (AP), if not something wrong the will be see a new AP with hostapd program. also the proxy,plugin should be initialized.

> `stop`

stop access point, process, thread, plugin and proxies that is running in background.

> `ignore`

the message logger will be ignored, the parameters can be ( `captiveflask`,  `pumpkinproxy`,  `pydns_server`  `sniffkin3` ). if you type this command not  be see anymore log in console WP.

> `restore`

the message logger will be restored, as you can see above this command is inverse of `ignore` with same parameters will be restore the console log.

> `info`

> `jobs`

show all threads/processes in background. Sometimes you need to find the process id or thread name of process created by WP.

> `mode`

show all wireless mode available.

> `plugins`

show all plugins available and their status.

> `proxies`

show all proxies available and their status.


> `show`

show available modules.

> `search`

search  modules by name, this will be implemented in the future when milion od modules :sunglasses: is avaliable 


> `use`

select module for modules, full inspiration in metasploit modules.

> `dump`

dump informations from client connected on AP.

> `dhcpconf`
